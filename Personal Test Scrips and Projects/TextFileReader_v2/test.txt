1595108433 UNIX EPOCH TIME for Saturday, July 18, 2020 @ 3:40:33PM GMT-06:00 DST

The Unix epoch (or Unix time or POSIX time or Unix timestamp) is the number of seconds that have elapsed since
January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap seconds (in ISO 8601: 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). Literally
speaking the epoch is Unix time 0 (midnight 1/1/1970), but 'epoch' is often used as a synonym for Unix time.
Some systems store epoch dates as a signed 32-bit integer, which might cause problems on January 19, 2038
(known as the Year 2038 problem or Y2038). The converter on this page converts timestamps in seconds (10-digit),
milliseconds (13-digit) and microseconds (16-digit) to readable dates.
